Kafka Deep Dive :-

Usage : Used mainly for high throughput event streaming and message queing.

Components

1. Producers (Publish messages using Producer Api)
2. Consumers (Consume messages using Consumer Api)
3. Kafka Cluster (Holds the brain of the system ,eg - All consumers commit their offsetr values to the cluster for use in case they go down)
4. Message Brokers (Receives messages and routes them to the designated partition)
5. Partition (Used for separating traffic by use case of scalability)
6. Topics (Logical division of messages in the application itself)
7. Partition Key (Present in every message. Used to decide which partition , this message is destined for.)
8. Consumer Groups (Used primarily to ensure that a message from a topic is consumed only once. Genrally every consumer group has a designated topic. Every consumer in a group has a designated partition range from which to consume.)
